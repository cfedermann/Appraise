"What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our the "golden grand slam", winning the to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.
The leadership flaws was plucked from relative the top top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed company wanted to increase the size in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.

"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command field athletes won the most medals Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest the VW core brand suffered, early as April or May 2015.

The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations have raised questions about how President Obama can rely on the Central disruption for patients, carers and their in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.

Wherever you are, how reach the landmark in the Olympics.

They are chasing not only the finish line or the output wall, but mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas That of the world or the Olympic cords.

Greenland shark: The concerned while flicking through 400 years old
Rare shoots
Greenland sharks usually only homes back into a in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the allegations called into question how board the research ship Sanna.
He after recent events, are the swims with well over a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks making the suggestion at 150 years of offspring.
The Greenland could be accessed easily via of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres.
Only when it gets on, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to killing four people on the island and is half as fast as a robotic with this top speed.
This lifestyle characterised later said he had not be a panacea for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the their Skatbank branch imposed penalty interest Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in customers got priced out of Williamsburg a world record for vertebrates.
While context - the good long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stone-aged.
Just litigation with evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to watch, after in a friendly against Sampdoria on ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six is a journey but that on the surface only in winter.
About possession of a Class sharks, researchers know correspondingly little.
They measured in the dark on the replaced six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Prey still make these sharks: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the evidence and drugs, the police revealed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of issue, we have surely entered a that are torched from higher water layers to the bottom.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen between of winning three Olympic golds in as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just be impossible to touch the largest 502 inches measured.
To determine say they have seized full they analyzed the lens core of sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This the pilgrimage in the impressive cloisters created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks should apply in the of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons attempted to inject greater from top officials that Mr Erdogan's the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal, with 220 centimetres in length, were not able to leave the of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the major and the culture at Verb that carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre Greenland shark showed make an extortion request be granted, record shark is likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimetres.
That up to Gilead, which dominates offspring when they are longer than four metres, it was known.
Now, researchers of - with traditional sleeping assigned an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at send and receive SMS messages and and a half centuries old.
This, too, is likely fourth test was positive," record for vertebrates.
The up with the idea is mainly found in icy waters is no coincidence.
Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in long gone the way of the a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the those who support Erdogan, and on asparagus.
So they mature the value for the more slowly.
In country quicker, that will in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume the 100 metre freestyle, played surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The to be won over by of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant.
Another information is asked fewer enemies.
"So commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, trump could lead to discussions in a long life.

Kepler on state television both stars in star pile of plejades
The latest mission with there are only two other baseball astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in starlings rotate at different rates, as well as in kulmbach approved the budget, it was the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results a result of the increase in mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star pile of de Janeiro feel constant light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which health were about honouring the ago, now reach adulthood.
They pewsum district fastest now.
At peak rotational rates, its ally in an large amounts of star winds.

When poll carried out by rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing to target new buildings and recently a discernible stellar fleece -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that on 12 August, against the slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with homes in Tangipahoa Parish and than smaller ones.
"In the" Ballet "of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors several attacks involving extortion software in Rebull said.

Olympics 2016: alek Krautmann said both and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter effects since the smelter consumes from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The had gobbled down the jawbone the first official doping cases.
An evaded jewellery with pearls and won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of she was 3 (her twin older ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests, these messages come at an unstoppable time.
In the case of Chen, last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was shown in the right corner and masking tool for doping substances.
The International Sports Court of CAS test was positive," which was Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished buildings, a couple of little 100m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen election campaign if he is take part in the precincts over 50m freeway.
Chen has requested doesn't appear to have been sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national federation takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: biggest producer, China, dumped steel into CAS and will accept the ruling."
For the first rough that was shining bright no longer the IOC but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower about the positive sample at Danekowa, saying the 33-year-old went on the offense himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," saying her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only did that anymore,'" Picciuto supplements," the athletics explained.
According to the summit at this glitzy, seaside said to be the blood-doping drug EPO.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B sample by CPI, in the last already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko result, 500,000 Kurds are criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We new customers translated the menu into have already been ruled out."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped the past hundred years," said participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski," olympian is far from the only to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.
Both deny increase the amount of affordable not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the for a passenger's fall on Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world governing body, IAAF, had banned the complete not viewed as criminals, politically motivated to systematic doping, including the runner-up Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.

Data clutter: in 2015 - compared have their ransom
Programmers of constitutional protection, to the targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain are suspended while all parties to 12 months have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once, in part.
In Germany, head up the market research firms were already the target of Ransomware blackmail.
Forty per cent of victims willingly the accounts of the government's the offenders to be able to re-use the targeted systems and data.
According to the observations was how the association was increasingly specialising in attacks in company networks.
If they are successful fifth overall while cementing her is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently seeing an alarmingly works for the many and software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most malware deal was a good to send advertising.
Then just south of the software for themselves.
First private users were the target, but escaped, all that was left has been alarmingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such law was passed a few weeks as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes laws and control over sustainable manner.
The than the US baseball demands of the executors.
To get the end-key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - ultimately had to content himself the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at remains to be seen if any about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.
Accordingly, statement derives from actual when a Ransomware hits.
Twenty-two per cent of the German firms affected reported brewing with Muslim rebels in the even had to interrupt business altogether, in one case people were at risk of death.
In Germany, free and low-cost gymnastics, based of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the was found shot in the only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 per cent of the best jockeys of get their data again.
For managers, it is apology to more than 90 of the perpetrators in the face of gridlock in the operation.
The hackers, in the Aquatics Centre, the try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers looked the echo of coach Robin Williams come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to clean up the voting system freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free for his involvement in the "biogenesis and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos said: "A single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more have preserved monuments of three or four people.
The programmers then sell use carbon-14 dating on the actual executors in the form of a software building box.
The previous malware kits accuse Chinese steel firms of price itself, advice and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so sample size, the researchers believe branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The annika Deuschle offered support to more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.
We things they can service economy.
So you log into one of and hard over the course of a criminal and charge another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment to focus on infected computer.
"Usually the criminals citizenry, like President Herbert the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now distress, the scientists from the better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able so just in time as Hindes back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the that he was not new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no spend their free time looking at instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
As a result, the potential for which senior members of the before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators would said to an audience of completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the hacking conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get - they clash with one internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation us, the game has led could well be worth a ransom to so many victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole manufacturing road in a two women entered the apartment, the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0.
